# BANK CUSTOMER CHURN MODEL
The main objective of the Bank Churn Project is to predict customer churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention. 
We are having Imablanced data in this so we have two techniques for that: Oversampling and Undersampling. 
We use oversampling data as it will not eliminate the important values from dataset.
To make best model, we will run various models and finally select the good one i.e; Random Forest Classifier.
We had to use the Over Sampling data because if we use the normal inbalance data we will get a good ACCURACY (82%, 77%, ....) but we will not get a proper RECALL (20%, 25%, ...) which implies that our model is good at predict the churning. Eventhough accuracy is good but the recall of the interested category i.e; churn is not good.
